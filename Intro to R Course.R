#Tips:
#ctrl + 1 = move cursor to script

#ctrl + 2 = move cursor to console

#use up and down arrows to cycle through history in console, instead of copy 
#and paste 

#use home and end buttons to jump from start of line to end of line and back 
#on pc, for mac use function + left or right arrows 

#ctrl + L = clear the console, but not actually deleting anything

#Boolean is a variable that takes on two different values: TRUE or FALSE

#(Alt) + (-) = <- 

#name_things_like_this, not.like.this

#numeric variables are decimal numbers, integer variables are the single 
#integers (1, 2, 3..... not 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.....) (1L, 2L, 3L = integers)

#na.rm = TRUE means that the NA values will be removed from output
